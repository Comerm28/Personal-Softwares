# To-Do List & Habit Tracker

This project is a simple To-Do List and Habit Tracker application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to manage their tasks and track their completion over time.

## Files

- **todo.py**: Contains the main application logic, including functions to load and save data, add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and update the task list display. It also sets up the graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

- **todo_data.txt**: A JSON file used to store tasks and their completion dates. The application reads from this file to load existing tasks and writes to it when tasks are added or marked as completed.

## Features

- Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Mark tasks as completed, tracking the days they were completed.
- View the number of days each task has been completed.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

## Usage

1. Run the application by executing `todo.py`.
2. Use the "Add Task" button to enter a new task.
3. Select a task from the list and click "Mark Completed" to track its completion.
4. Close the application using the "Exit" button, which will save your tasks.
